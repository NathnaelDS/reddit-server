# Reddit, but smaller - backend

I learned to build full-stack apps. I worked through Ben Awad's [Fullstack React GraphQL TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8)

This is my backend for the app. This was my main focus as I'd been a frontend engineer for a while.

The code for my frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/NathnaelDS/reddit-web).

These were the things covered in the tutorial, but I learned **a lot** more as I researched while building this app.
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- GraphQL
- PostgreSQL
- MikroORM, later replaced by TypeORM
- Redis
- TypeGraphQL
- React
- Next.js
- URQL/Apollo
- Chakra
